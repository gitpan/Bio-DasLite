Bio-DasLite version 0.02
==========================

Bio::DasLite is an implementation of the BioDas protocol, http://biodas.org/
for the retrieval of biological data from XML sources over HTTP.

Bio::DasLite is designed as a lightweight and more forgiving alternative to
the client/retrieval/parsing components of Bio::Das. Bio::DasLite itself is
not a drop-in replacement for Bio::Das but it can be subclassed to do so
(and probably will in a short-term future release).
