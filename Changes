Revision history for Perl extension Bio::DasLite.

0.06  Fixes for the regex/stack problems in 0.05.
      Added callback support for stylesheet and features calls

0.05  Stylesheet support. Seems to tickle some perl regex/stack bugs
      on certain platforms (x86 Linux, Alpha Tru64). It works fine on my G4.

0.04  Internal version. Added duplication of segment data across
      features in the 'features' call.

0.03  Allowed for calls (namely 'features') with an arrayref of
      segments, i.e. $das->features(["1:1,1000", "2:1,1000"]);
      Minor modifications following some benchmarking and profiling.
      Results are now cached (per Bio::DasLite instance) against
      query URL by default.

0.02  Following feedback, data structures returned by:
      dsn, basename, dsns, entry_points, types, features, sequence
      have now been homogenised across the board. Results are now
      always hashed against the query which was made, regardless
      of how many sources are configured.
      Also added a few more tests including feature-by-id
