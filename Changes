Revision history for Perl extension Bio::DasLite.

1.39  Minor typographical tidying up, some more tests

1.38  Minor tweaks to http_proxy - support for http://user:pass@proxy.example.com:nnnn/ format http_proxy

1.33  Minor tweaks to proxy_* methods; Addition of configurable user_agent

1.32  Bugfixes: Cache cleaning for performing multiple queries using persistent objects
                Regex fixes for group notes and links
                Initial support for authenticating proxies (proxy_user, proxy_pass)

1.27  Switched over to CVS version to make things easier for me to track
      Minor revisions. Some more tests
 
0.15  Includes registry support.
      See 'new_from_registry', 'registry' and 'registry_sources' methods.

0.14  Fix for entry_points structure and a new test for it
      Added a new way to use the constructor: my $das = Bio::DasLite->new("http://server/das/source");
      Added a convenience side-effect - give segment data in responses for segments without features in

0.13  Absolutely minor change to include LWP::P::UA max_req connection throttling
      Upgrade strongly recommended

0.12  Reworked all the tests.
      Tweaked basename regex to allow more flexibility in
      specifying services rather than dsns, i.e.
      'dsn' => 'http://das.mysite.com/das'
      rather than
      'dsn' => 'http://das.mysite.com/das/dsn'

0.11  Added a little extra debug, some extra eval traps, improved url processing
      and a couple of new WTSI extensions to the spec

0.10  Fixed dsns DAS request (source basename)

0.09  Fixed broken 'types' request

0.08  Added multi-link, multi-note, multi-group-link and multi-group-note support
      Added X-Forwarded-For HTTP header for IP-based ACLs
      Added passthrough for HTTP header data

0.07  Internal development version

0.06  Fixes for the regex/stack problems in 0.05.
      Added callback support for stylesheet and features calls

0.05  Stylesheet support. Seems to tickle some perl regex/stack bugs
      on certain platforms (x86 Linux, Alpha Tru64). It works fine on my G4.

0.04  Internal version. Added duplication of segment data across
      features in the 'features' call.

0.03  Allowed for calls (namely 'features') with an arrayref of
      segments, i.e. $das->features(["1:1,1000", "2:1,1000"]);
      Minor modifications following some benchmarking and profiling.
      Results are now cached (per Bio::DasLite instance) against
      query URL by default.

0.02  Following feedback, data structures returned by:
      dsn, basename, dsns, entry_points, types, features, sequence
      have now been homogenised across the board. Results are now
      always hashed against the query which was made, regardless
      of how many sources are configured.
      Also added a few more tests including feature-by-id
