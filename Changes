Revision history for Perl extension Bio::DasLite.

0.03  Allowed for calls (namely 'features') with an arrayref of
      segments, i.e. $das->features(["1:1,1000", "2:1,1000"]);
      Minor modifications following some benchmarking and profiling.
      Results are now cached (per Bio::DasLite instance) against
      query URL by default.

0.02  Following feedback, data structures returned by:
      dsn, basename, dsns, entry_points, types, features, sequence
      have now been homogenised across the board. Results are now
      always hashed against the query which was made, regardless
      of how many sources are configured.
      Also added a few more tests including feature-by-id
